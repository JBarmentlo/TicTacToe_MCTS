Looking for different ways to paralellize the MCTS process using CUDA C on a GPU.
It came to my attention the code is clunky and not so adaptable and decided to re write It
to allow me greater freedom of execution later and to adapt the code to use the scarce
GPU ressources I have at my disposal efficiently.

I want:
	- The process to be able to fit in shared memory (faster but 48k limit)
	- it to run fully on GPU. (so root paralellisation is possible)
	- Speed
	- To set a timeout to simulate real life situation.


IDEAS
	use powers of 4 instead of 3 to use bitshifts for smallest value
